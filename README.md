Coffee Machine (Non-Object-Oriented Version) â˜•ðŸ”§

This project is an early version of the coffee machine simulation, created as a quick draft to test basic functionality before implementing the object-oriented design. It focuses on getting the core features working with simple, procedural Python code.
Purpose

    Quickly prototype the coffee machineâ€™s core operations (selecting drinks, checking resources, refilling ingredients).
    Test and refine the application logic before converting it into a more robust object-oriented solution.
    Serve as a working draft to explore the concept before diving into more complex code structures.

Features

    Basic drink selection (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
    Resource tracking for water, milk, and coffee beans.
    Simple refill and shutdown options.
